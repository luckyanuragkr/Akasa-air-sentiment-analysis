**Introduction**
In this project, we scrape reviews from the Akasa Air website using Python and perform sentiment analysis to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. The goal is to derive insights into customer satisfaction and highlight areas for potential improvement.

**Tech Stack**
Language: Python 3.8+
Libraries:
  BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)
  Requests (for handling HTTP requests)
  Pandas (for data manipulation)
  NLTK/VADER (for sentiment analysis)
  Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
  Textblob(for sentiment analysis)


Usage
1. Web Scraping
The web scraping script extracts customer reviews from the Skytrax(https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/akasa-air/) website.


**Run the script:**
  Copy code
  python web_scraping.py
  The reviews will be saved to a CSV file for further analysis.
  
2. Data Preprocessing
Preprocess the scraped text data to clean and prepare it for sentiment analysis.
Remove stop words, airline-specific terms like "flight", and tokenize the text.

3. Sentiment Analysis
Perform sentiment analysis using the NLTK VADER tool to categorize the reviews.

The script will append a new column to the dataset with the sentiment score.
Sentiment Analysis
The sentiment analysis uses the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) algorithm, a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is particularly effective for social media and review-type data.

Sentiment Labels:
  Positive
  Negative
  Neutral
  
Visualization
  Visualize the distribution of sentiments using pie charts and bar charts.
